Lorem Ipsum is simply \textbf{\textit{dummy}} text of the \textit{printing} and \underline{typesetting} industry. \textsc{Lorem Ipsum} has been the industry's \textmd{standard} dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley

of type and scrambled it to make a \hfill type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, 
but also the leap into electronic typesetting, \textup{remaining} essentially unchanged.It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with \vspace{5cm}\\ desktop publishing software \hspace{5cm} like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum
